# cmpe256-hw2

This homework assignment is been done on HPC. However, I failed to train models with COCO dataset.

My HPC account has been locked. These approachs I had been done are listed below. 

I tried both Tensorflow2 and Pytorch, I failed in the some config and I dont know how to continue. I Google and went to piazza for helps with no luck.

Small conclusion with Tensorflow2:

It is powerful but sometime its hard to debug, IT said I failed with missing module named 'absl', but I install it with pip and run it on CLI and saw no problem at all. However, it doesnt work on the notebook..

Small conclusion with Pytorch:

It can be coustom with so many variables since the model can be trained in low level code. However, when I am using for this training, it show batch size does not matched beetween trained output and coco annotaion .

I failed when I calculating the losses.

# Train on Colab

I also attend to use colab with both Tensorflow and Pytorch for this homework. I failed to load the dataset for some reason.
