# cmpe256-hw2

This homework assignment is been done on HPC. However, I failed to train models with COCO dataset.

I tried both Tensorflow2 and Pytorch, I failed in the some config and I dont know how to continue. I Google and went to piazza for helps with no luck.

Small conclusion with Tensorflow2:

It is powerful but sometime its hard to debug, IT said I failed with missing module named 'absl', but I install it with pip and run it on CLI and saw no problem at all. However, it doesnt work on the notebook..

Small conclusion with Pytorch:

It can be coustom with so many variables since the model can be trained in low level code. However, when I am using for this training, it show batch size does not matched beetween trained output and coco annotaion .

I failed when I calculating the losses.
